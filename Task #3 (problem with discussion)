Using the language JavaScript— to write a console script that implements a generalized non-transitive dice game (with the supports of arbitrary values on the dice).
When launched with command line parameters—arguments to the main or Main method in the case of Java or C# correspondingly, sys.argv in Python, process.argv in Node.js, etc.—it accepts 3 or more strings, each containing 6 comma-separated integers. E.g., python game.py 2,2,4,4,9,9 6,8,1,1,8,6 7,5,3,7,5,3. In principle, you may support any number of faces on a dice, like 4 or 20, but it's not very important.

If the arguments are incorrect, you must display a neat error message,not a stacktrace—what exactly is wrong and an example of how to do it right (e.g., user specified only two dice or no dice at all, used non-integers, etc.). All messages should be in English.

Important: dice configuration is passed as command line arguments; you don't "parse" it from the input stream. The victory is defined as follows—computer and user select different dice, perform their "rolls," and whoever rolls higher wins. The first step of the game is to determine who makes the first move. You have to prove to the user that choice is fair (it's not enough to generate a random bit 0 or 1; the user needs a proof of the fair play). When the users make the roll, they select dice using CLI "menu" and "generate" a random value with the help of the computer. The options consist of all the available dice, the exit (cancel) option, and the help option. When the computer makes the roll, it selects dice and "generates" a random value. 
Of course, "random" generation is also should be provable fair.

Please, note that the task is not "to implement some dice game". You need to implement all the specified requirements, including fair random generation, configurable dice, classes with limited responsibilities, etc. If fact, it's not a "dice game" at all, but rather a mathematical model of intransitive relations. You can think of the "higher" face result as "better" or "nicer" or any other relation. As far as I know, there is no such games in reality. So, you need to implement provable "fair" random integer generation (other from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 5).

To generate such a value, the computer generates a one-time cryptographically secure random key (using corresponding API like SecureRandom, RandomNumberGenerator, random_bytes, etc.—it's mandatory) with a length of at least 256 bits. Then the computer generates a uniformly distributed integer in the required range (using secure random; note that % operator is not enough to get uniform distribution) and calculates HMAC (based on SHA3) from the generated integers as a message with the generated secret key. Then the computer displays the HMAC to the user. After that, the user selects an integer in the same range. The resulted value is calculated as the sum of user number and computer number using modular arithmetic. When the computer displays the result, it also shows the used secret keys.
The sequence is critical (it simply doesn't make sense to do it differently, for example, showing the key before the user number selection or displaying HMAC the second time instead of the key, etc.).

Note that each "fair random generation" requires the participation of both parties, the user and the computer; just to generate random number and print it is not enough. Thus the user can check that the computer doesn't cheat (of course, the computer can still try to cheat, but the user can counteract to that). When you select the "help" option in the terminal, you need to display a table (use ASCII-graphic) that shows probabilities of winning for each dice pair.

The table generation should be in a separate class. The probability calculation should be in a separate class. The implementation of the fair number generation "protocol" should be in a separate class. The random key/number generation and HMAC calculation should be in a separate class. The dice configuration parsing should be in a separate class. The dice abstraction should be in a separate class. Generally, your code should consist of at least 6-9 classes. You should use the core class libraries and third-party libraries to the maximum, and not reinvent the wheel. 

THE NUMBER OF DICE CAN BE ARBITRARY ( > 2).

The first "fair generation" (0 or 1) should determine who selects the dice first. The opponents select different dice and after that dice rolls are performed (in fact, the order of rolls should be unimportant, because they use different dice). Of course, both computer's and user's rolls should be "fair" (use "input" from both parties).

And as an explanation: when calculating HMAC, the key is the same secret key that you generated. And the message is a number. After getting the key, the user will be able to calculate the HMAC and compare it with the HMAC that was shown before. It's not very difficult. Each "fair random" depends on numbers, generated by both players (human and computer). HMAC is used to prove that computer did't change its number after user made the selection. A common mistake is trying to invent your "HMAC" as a hash of a random "key." This will not work. If you show the same lines before the user selection and after the user selection, the user does not receive new information, and, accordingly, you do not prove anything to him. It is necessary to generate a key (with a secure generator), generate a computer value, calculate HMAC (by a standard algorithm) from a computer value (message) and a key (key), show HMAC, get a user value, calculate the result and show the key. Re-read this paragraph until the total comprehension.

So:

The player wants to play a general non-transitive dice game. Well, not a game per se, let's say it's a mathematical model of non-transitive relations (in fact, it's common for games of chance to have transitive relations). Users specify what dice they want to use. The main idea is the possible non-transitivity of the dice (the second die wins over the first, the third wins over the second, but the third loses to the first). No dice can be hardcoded in the code; dice are passed as arguments.
It's possible to play with 3 dice, or 4 dice, or 17 dice, or any number of dice greater than 2.
The player wants to have proof that the computer did not cheat because the second player can have a serious advantage. But at the same time, of course, the player wants to play "with interest," i.e., the player does not want to be able to always select the highest possible value.
If this is clear, everything further is trivial and can be implemented in an hour or two.

Note that "fair" procedure generates dice face index, not the "roll result." Users can specify any order for face values when they run the application.
Sometimes words aren't enough, so here is a diagram for collaborative random number generation in the range from 0 to 5 inclusive for the TASK #3 (it should used for both user's and computer's moves as well initial "who selects the dice first" determination).

How to improve usability of the console help table (make it more understandable).
First of all, you may render header row with some emphasis. E.g. use some color. 
Second, you fill the headers with some adequate content, like this:

Probability of the win fоr the user:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| User dice v | 2,2,4,4,9,9 | 1,1,6,6,8,8 | 3,3,5,5,7,7 |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 2,2,4,4,9,9 | .𝟹𝟹𝟹𝟹       | .5556       | .4444       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1,1,6,6,8,8 | .4444       | .𝟹𝟹𝟹𝟹       | .5556       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 3,3,5,5,7,7 | .5556       | .4444       | .𝟹𝟹𝟹𝟹       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Please, remember that integers can be larger than 9, so you cannot predefine the column widths. 
Table  should be rendered properly, borders should be straight, not jagged, etc.
Anyway, you have to use a 3rd-party library for the table output. 
The diagonals are formatted differently, because the dice cannot play against itself, but it is still possible to calculate the probability; you may simple print - or just print the probability, if you want.
And, last, but not least, you may add some text before the table (e.g., to help to understand the game rules).
Of course, for large number of dice it would be nice to implement some kind of pagination, but it's out of the scope of the basic task (you may consider it as an optional "for the highest grade" problem).

Just a few more hint/explanations about #3:
You have to use base class libraries and 3rd-party libaries for the implementation (esp. for console table generation).
Your code generates a secret key first, then it generates a random value and then show only HMAC to the user. After that the user generates their value. Then your code shows its number, sum, generated move as well as the secret key. And then user can check the fact that the computer value and the secret key give together exactly the same HMAC that was shown before.
You may generate a link that allows HMAC calculation to simplify the "check" for the user, but it's not required. And definitely your don't need to create a separate app to check HMAC, the idea is that user may not trust the code you wrote.
A value from the computer and a value from the user are needed to make a single roll. So, the computer have to generate 3 numbers (0..1 to determine who select the dice first, 0..5 for the user roll and 0..5 for the computer roll) and the user have to enter 3 numbers (0..1 to determine who select the dice first, 0..5 for own roll and 0..5 for the computer roll). Or, in other words, each generation requires the participation of both parties, the user and the computer. Of course, there will be also 3 keys and 3 HMAC per game in total.
The “protocol” with HMAC allow to generate 2 numbers (one by computer, one by user) “in parallel”, independently — when user selects their  number, he/she doesn’t know the computer selection yet, but the computer cannot change its selection after user’s moves. So, the result depends on computer number AND user number. And it’s necessary to “glue” two numbers to get a uniform distribution. The simplest way is to use modular addition.

Please, note that you need to use already implemented HMAC function, not to recreate it from hash for yourself, because there are some tricky non-obvious details.
